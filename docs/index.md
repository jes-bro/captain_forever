# Welcome to Captain Forever!

## The goal
Captain Forever is an exhilarating spaceship adventure game that transports you, the captain, into the role of an interstellar pilot being pursued by a fleet of formidable enemy ships. In the midst of a cosmic field, you’ll navigate a single ship through formations of enemies that periodically cross your path. If you stay still too long, the enemies will lock on to your position and overwhelm you with their canons! You must return fire all while avoiding collisions and dodging counter-fire to survive. If you get hit by the enemies three times you will explode, but if you can destroy the pursuing fleet before reinforcements arrive you win!

## Gameplay Features + Instructions

Piloting the ship is controlled by the arrow keys. Forward and backward acceleration are controlled by the up and down arrow keys, and clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation is controlled by the left and right arrow keys. Be careful with your speed, because there is no drag in space - you won’t slow down unless you accelerate in the opposite direction!

To fire your cannon, press the spacebar. At any time you can exit the game by pressing the escape key. 

You start the game with 3 lives, and each time you are hit by a laser your lives reduce by one. When you have zero lives, you explode!

The enemy ships will rotate to face your position, and then pursue you while firing. They are less maneuverable than you, and you can use the edges of the screen to disorient them when you appear in a new location. The more enemies you destroy, the faster their reinforcements arrive - you’ll have to be quick to defeat the fleet!

Once the game is over, you can restart using the enter key or exit the game with the escape key.

## Attributions 

This game would not have been possible without the open-source Pygame library. It is used to process sprites, physics, and all other aspects of gameplay in this implementation. 

We also benefited a lot from the following [Real Python Tutorial](https://realpython.com/asteroids-game-python/), using it to help enhance our understanding of PyGame and asteroids-style games in general.

Our implementation of Captain Forever is inspired by classic arcade video games "Captain Forever' and "Asteroids". 

The original "Captain Forever" was a multidirectional shooter video game designed by developer Jarred "Farbs" Woods in 2009, which was inspired by two other games called "Warning Forever" and "Battleships Forever". This was the original inspiration for our game

Asteroids, a space-themed multidirectional shooter game, is among the earliest of its kind, designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Logg. It was released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. Our spaceship movement and laser physics are inspired by Asteroids.
