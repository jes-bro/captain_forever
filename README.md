# Welcome to Captain Forever

Conquer the infinite expanse of space and become the ultimate Captain Forever!

## The big idea

Captain Forever is an exhilarating spaceship adventure game that transports you, the captain, into the role of an interstellar pilot on a mission to evade and destroy formidable enemy ships. In the midst of a cosmic field, you'll navigate a single spaceship while facing flying enemy ships that pursue and attempt to destroy you. If you take too many hits, you will explode! Your objective is to strategically shoot and annihilate them, all while avoiding collisions and dodging counter-fire. If you can destroy all of the enemy ships before reinforcements appear, you win!
